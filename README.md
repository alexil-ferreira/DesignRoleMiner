# DesignRoleMiner
Design Role Miner is a tool to identify the design role of each class from systems hosted on github. We use data from (1) class annotations, (2) inheritance and (3) implmented interfaces to do that.

The systems extends the metricminer tool adding new method-level metrics and the approach to design role identifying.
